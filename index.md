## Hi there 👋

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Ljubljana, where I got my **MSc in computer science**. 
I am on the lookout for opportunities that will enable me to improve my skills, expand my knowledge and put it to good use on practical and relevant projects.

During my studies I gained an interest in a variety of fields, namely **computer vision**, **computer graphics** and **AI**. Lately, I am focused on the problem of pathfinding in video games, trying out new approaches in a complex game environment. This was also the subject matter of my [master's thesis](https://github.com/ia6382/OpenRA).\
I enjoy researching publications, understanding the underlying theory and then programming a solution, which can bring new improvements to the community. 
You can find some of my projects on [this page](./projects.html).\
I am passionate about **game development** as it enables me to translate my CS knowledge into a highly creative and artistic environment. Check out a few games I made so far [here](https://ivan-antesic.itch.io/). 

Besides gaming I enjoy hiking 🌄, history 📚 and various handicrafts such as woodworking 🌳 and blacksmithing 🔨. I also keep seven very happy chickens in my backyard 🐔. 

If you are interested in my work or anything of the above or maybe you just want to discuss the finer points of 1982's Conan the Barbarian feel free to send me an email at [ivan.v.antesic@gmail.com](mailto:ivan.v.antesic@gmail.com).
