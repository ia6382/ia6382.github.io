Click the title for more details.

___

**[Multi-Agent Pathfinding in a RTS Game](https://github.com/ia6382/OpenRA#about)**
* My CS master's thesis
* An implementation of the seminal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm WHCA* in an open source real-time strategy game engine OpenRA
* Tests the claims of scientific research that the algorithm is very suitable for use in RTS games
* As far as I know this is the only working implementation of a multi-agent pathfinding algorithm in a real game environment
* *C#, LUA, YAML, Python, Batch, Git*

___

**[RTS Game Pathfinding](https://github.com/ia6382/rts-pathfinding)**
* Implementation and testing of several popular single-agent pathfinding algorithms for RTS games
* Created a prototype RTS game with ASCII graphics for testing
* *Python, libtcod*

___

**[Wolf Attack Simulation](https://github.com/ia6382/wolf-attack-simulation)**
* Wolf attack on a flock of sheep procedural animation and guard dog effectiveness analysis 
* A group project of two people
* I implemented a realistic collision avoidance system for the animals in the simulation according to Reynold's seminal "Boids" article
* Tested several collective behaviour algorithms
* *C#, Python, Unity*

___

**[PC Game SKRAT](https://ivan-antesic.itch.io/skrat)**
* My CS bachelor's thesis: [Game development from the perspective of an independent developer](http://eprints.fri.uni-lj.si/4151/)
* Studied the video game production process and created a 2D action pixel art game by following the production phases
* Made all of the assets except the soundtrack myself
* *C#, Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Pyxel Edit*

___

<!-- ___
**[Mobile Game SpikeRust](https://ivan-antesic.itch.io/spikerust)**
* A simple 2D pixel art endless climber game for Android and PC
* *C#, Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Pyxel Edit*

___

**[PC Game Skye](https://github.com/ia6382/SKYE-game)**
* 3D first-person parkour game
* Made in a group of four programmers 
* I made the textures, and the level design and helped with the bugs 
* *C#, Unity, Adobe Photoshop, Git*

___ -->

**[Mobile Game Disco Ant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.discoant&hl=en)**
* Result of the Outfit7 talent camp I attended in 2018 - a two-week summer workshop hosted in Ljubljana 
* Made a 3D rhythm-based mobile game as a team of 8 people (4 programmers, 2 artists and a game designer)
* Published on Google Play after further polishing and company's framework integration
* I programmed the level generation with a parallax scrolling background I was in charge of the Unity project itself: 
I worked closely with the artists to give them our requirements and integrated their assets into the project and connected them to various scripts made by myself and other programmers
* I really enjoyed collaborating with the artists, learning about their tools and complementing each other's skills to create amazing art such as particle effects and the cell shading effect
* Helped the company with their framework integration in Android Studio - made the loading screen with a tip of the day, loading bar and a custom background made by the artists
* *C#, Java, Unity, Android Studio, Git*

**You can check out all other games I made so far on my [itch.io profile](https://ivan-antesic.itch.io/).**

* Tested on visual object tracking benchmark sequences
* *Matlab*

___

<!-- ___

**[People Counter](https://github.com/ia6382/people-counter)**
